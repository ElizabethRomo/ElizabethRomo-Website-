        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first year student at the University of California, Riverside. My major is political science. I am planning to declare my concentration in Law and Society because after I graduate from college I hope to attend law school. So far I have enjoyed most of the classes I have taken at UCR. In fact, my favorite class was Politics of the Underdeveloped World. I enjoyed learning about the history and political structure of countries, such as Mexico, Zimbabwe, Peru, and Iran. As a result of what I learned, I now want to study abroad in a forgien country, so that I am able to learn more about the culture of forgien countries. Another class I enjoyed, is Cultural Anthropology. In this class, I was able to learn more about my own culture and other cultures as well.
<br><br>

        Furthermore, I like to keep myself busy with multiple extracurricular activities. In the past I have been in the Younger Legislators 58th District Program, where I regularly volunteered in my community and learned about local politics. From this program I learned about the issues my community faces, like pollution and deportation. Also, I was involved in debate club. There I participated in informal debates over controversial topics such as immigration policies and reproductive rights. I enjoyed being able to interact and discuss my perspectives with others who had different perspectives from me. 
<br><br>

        Additionally, I was in the first AP Capstone program at my high school. In the program, I conducted my own correlational and ethnographic research study. The study was conducted in the suburbs of Los Angeles and it researched the factors that influence Hispanics to purchase organic food. My studyâ€™s results found that socioeconomic status had a positive correlation with the amount of organic food purchased by hispanics. The results also indicated that accessibility, perception and price had no association with the amount of organic food purchased. At the end of my study, I concluded that Hispanics that have a higher socioeconomic status have a higher tendency to purchase organic food. By conducting my own study, I learned how to be proactive, independent, do statistical analysis and communicate with other researchers as well. Fortunately, I had an academic advisor assist and mentor me while I was conducting my research. My advisor was in the process of completing her dissertation and she was able to offer me valuable advice. Moreover, I feel that research opportunities are important to my education. This is why I choose to attend UC Riverside, since it is known as a research school.
